Subject: Key Insights and Recommendations for Customer Retention

Dear Janet,

I hope you're doing well. Based on my analysis of the Customer Retention report, here are the key findings and suggested improvements:

Key Insights:
1. High Churn Rate: 
The overall churn rate stands at 26.54%, with electronic check users being the most likely to churn (1,071 churned customers).
2. Contract Type Influence: 
Month-to-month contracts account for 55% of customers (3,880 out of 7,043), with a significantly higher churn rate than annual contracts.
3. Senior Citizen Retention: 
Senior citizens make up 16.2% of retained customers, with lower retention compared to younger demographics.
4. Internet Service Impact: 
Fibre optic users have the highest churn, accounting for 69.4% of churned customers.
5. Paperless Billing: 
Customers opting for paperless billing churn at a higher rate (74.9%) than those who donâ€™t.


Recommendations:
1. Contract Length Strategies: 
Introduce incentives for month-to-month users to switch to annual contracts, such as discounts or added perks.
2. Senior Citizen Engagement: 
Offer customized plans or discounts tailored to senior citizens to improve retention.
3. Payment Method Optimization: 
Investigate why electronic check users churn more and consider offering alternative, seamless payment options.
4. Fibre Optic User Retention: 
Conduct surveys to understand dissatisfaction among fibre optic users and improve service quality.
5. Paperless Billing Communication: 
Ensure better communication and education for customers opting for paperless billing to reduce churn.
