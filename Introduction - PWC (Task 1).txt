During this experience with PwC’s Power BI job simulation, I hope to enhance my data visualization skills and learn how to create impactful, business-driven reports. I’m particularly excited to explore real-world datasets, improve my ability to derive meaningful insights, and understand how data storytelling supports decision-making.
